* MUST
  * Build support for the Nephilim powers which are based off the Amberite powers
  * Make sure the forked tongue mutation is properly implemented
  * Teach the borg how to work the cloak of Draebor
  * Teach the borg about mushrooms of fright and third sight ( < SV_FOOD_MIN_OKAY from zborg6.h)
  * Teach the borg about alchemy
  * WATER is a mess of between deep and low water, I need to streamline this
  * The healer is not on the hardcoded place of borg_flow_enqueue_grid(26, 83);
  * Check all artefact powers, handling of ART_SAMAEL is known to be weak
  * The borg needs to learn/fear Lilith instead of just Morgoth
  * Validate the sign powers
  * Validate that draco power always has a GF_ type

* SHOULD
  * zborg1.h /*TODO: understand the difference between track_shop and track_building*/
  * Verify zborg3.c:borg_mutation
  * Does Orb of Draining still destroy cursed non-artefacts?
  * Make RACE_LILITH and RACE_LUCIFER flexible
  * Should have a temp resist poison artefact, even a random res poison power
  * Verify that Handle "satisfy hunger" properly deals with Vampires
  * The borg flows now to 'bad' potions to throw them.. We should probably only flow if we know they are part of a recipe
  * Implement RF6_S_ANGEL, I am guessing that S_KIN solves this??
  * Implement quest_number with Lilith and Lucifer and restore the quest logic
    * is_borg_quest_monster is already done
  * Consider adding half orcs back, they are the other side of the Elven coin
  * Unhardcode the Mage Guild name and basement name, it should use the f_info.txt Entry
  * Swappable artefact for genocide.. (Replacement for Celeborn)
  * Check all the corruptions, BF_COR1_LASER_EYE seems to have changed quite a bit
  * Put difficulties of powers in to the power array

* NICE
  * move total_weight to p_ptr->total_weight
  * make cmd2.c use the corruption table..
  * Use zborg3.c diff calculation to cmd2.c to be used by Hellband and the borg
  * Some files still mention the Logrus..
  * If we ever add the lava terrains, then the borg should like items that survive lava instead of avoiding them
  *

* Version 1.0.0
  * Add more races, Amberites are gone forever though
  * Add temporary brands
  * Add RBE_EXP_VAMP, poetic justice
  * Add Zombies in, but cool like, possibly turning denizens
  * Add Cyclopses in
  * Add blue, red, gray mages  in
  * Add Virgil lore, how could we not??

* UNLIKELY

*Documentation

* There is no name3 in Hellband, because Hellband does not yet have temporary brands
