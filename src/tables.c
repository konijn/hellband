/*
* This table is used to help calculate the number of blows the player can
* make in a single round of attacks (one player turn) with a normal weapon.
*
* This number ranges from a single blow/round for weak players to up to six
* blows/round for powerful warriors.
*
* Note that certain artefacts and ego-items give "bonus" blows/round.
*
* First, from the player class, we extract some values:
*
*    Warrior --> num = 6; mul = 5; div = MAX(30, weapon_weight);
*    Mage    --> num = 4; mul = 2; div = MAX(40, weapon_weight);
*    Priest  --> num = 5; mul = 3; div = MAX(35, weapon_weight);
*    Rogue   --> num = 5; mul = 3; div = MAX(30, weapon_weight);
*    Ranger  --> num = 5; mul = 4; div = MAX(35, weapon_weight);
*    Paladin --> num = 5; mul = 4; div = MAX(30, weapon_weight);
*
* To get "P", we look up the relevant "adj_str_blow[]" (see above),
* multiply it by "mul", and then divide it by "div", rounding down.
*
* To get "D", we look up the relevant "adj_dex_blow[]" (see above),
* note especially column 6 (DEX 18/101) and 11 (DEX 18/150).
*
* The player gets "blows_table[P][D]" blows/round, as shown below,
* up to a maximum of "num" blows/round, plus any "bonus" blows/round.

/*
* This table allows quick conversion from "speed" to "energy"
* The basic function WAS ((S>=110) ? (S-110) : (100 / (120-S)))
* Note that table access is *much* quicker than computation.
*
* Note that the table has been changed at high speeds.  From
* "Slow (-40)" to "Fast (+30)" is pretty much unchanged, but
* at speeds above "Fast (+30)", one approaches an asymptotic
* effective limit of 50 energy per turn.  This means that it
* is relatively easy to reach "Fast (+30)" and get about 40
* energy per turn, but then speed becomes very "expensive",
* and you must get all the way to "Fast (+50)" to reach the
* point of getting 45 energy per turn.  After that point,
* furthur increases in speed are more or less pointless,
* except to balance out heavy inventory.
*
* Note that currently the fastest monster is "Fast (+30)".
*
* It should be possible to lower the energy threshhold from
* 100 units to 50 units, though this may interact badly with
* the (compiled out) small random energy boost code.  It may
* also tend to cause more "clumping" at high speeds.

* but subtracting extract_energy[n] each move and always adding
* 10 per turn, rather than adding extract_energy[n] each turn and
* always subtracting 100.
*
* This has been done to allow the seperating out of movement speed
* and attack speed.
