- DREAMS


- Level 5 should have Minos' palace placed, with the only exit that points downstairs covering all other downstairs conveniently with rubble ( go calamarain ;)
- Allow Hell Knights to control the powers of Demonic Weapons ( basically : todo demonic weapons )
- allow clean_shot to use is_monster_killer(enemy, m_ptr)
- wtf is MFLAG_NICE
- Chaos Knights are not in
- drop_good_only drop_great_only bm_sells_thegoodstuff are not in
- cmd5.c is not using to the fullest the new spell capabilities
- Same classes should get access to more realms ( they will be bad at it, but role-players don't care )
- unique set drops
- Need a centralized U_power to description algorithm


- Find Roland Jay Roberts ( Found and waiting )
- Find Ross E Becker ( Found and waiting )
- Find Randy Hutson, the one that studied in the Math department of Texas ( not found )

- Do the major step of updating code to be doxygen compliant
- When generating skeletons, generate 2/3 'bad' object, 1/3 good object
	if ( dam > m_ptr->hp)

add #define STORES_SECOND_FLOOR 1          /**< Total number of stores in game, this includes 2nd floor stores, see store.c */

the stores array :
- Does store have inventory flux( no for town hall, house , chop shop, mages guild )
- Does store have multiple for selling ?
- Does store have multiple for buying ?
- Does never buy
- Has special title

GREAT IDEAS:

Thieves have greed level, once passed they leave the level, gold is gone, otherwise you can get it back.
Throwing potions should cause the potions effect on the target
