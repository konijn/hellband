# File: r_info.txt

# This file is used to initialize the "lib/raw/r_info.raw" file, which is
# used to initialize the "monster race" information for the Angband game.
# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing,
# unless you wish to risk possible system crashes and broken savefiles.

# The format of a monster is as follows... ([] indicates an optional part)

# N:<monster index>:<monster name>
# G:<monster symbol>:<monster colour>
# I:<movement speed>:<attack speed>:<hit points>:<perception>:<armour class>:<sleep>
# W:<level found at>:<rarity>:<unused>:<kill score>
# B:<attack type>[:<attack effect>][:<attack damage>]
# F:<flag1> | <flag2>...
# [S:<spell frequency>]
# [S:<spell1> | <spell2>...]

# 'I' is for information - speed, health, vision in tens of feet,
# armor class, and alertness. 110 is normal speed. Alertness ranges
# from 0 (ever vigilant for intruders) to 255 (prefers to ignore
# intruders).

# 'W' is for more information - level, rarity, and experience for
# killing. The third slot is currently unused.

# D - Dark Gray    w - White          s - Gray          o - Orange
# r - Red          g - Green          b - Blue          u - Brown
# d - Black        W - Light Gray     v - Violet        y - Yellow
# R - Light Red    G - Light Green    B - Light Blue    U - Light Brown

# (note that "black" is the same color as the screen background, and
# thus the monster will appear to be an empty black space if its
# color is "d".)

#Further notes : 
#Humans have open_door and bash_door, hardcoded for efficiency
#Fallen Angels and Dragons have FLIGHT, hardcoded for efficiency
#DROP_GOOD is no longer needed when DROP_GREAT is specified
#FORCE_MAXHP is no longer needed when UNIQUE is specified

#Dido, for example, was a mythological queen who committed suicide because of her unrequited love for Aeneas. 
#Maenads were female worshippers of Dionysus, the Greek god of mystery, wine and intoxication, and the Roman god Bacchus. The word literally translates as "raving ones". They were known as wild, insane women who could not be reasoned with. The mysteries of Dionysus inspired the women to ecstatic frenzy; they indulged in copious amounts of violence, bloodletting, sex and self-intoxication and mutilation. They were usually pictured as crowned with vine leaves, clothed in fawnskins and carrying the thyrsus, and dancing with the wild abandonment of complete union with primeval nature.
# Vannozza (Giovanna) dei Cattani (1442 - ?) was one of the many mistresses of the Pope Alexander VI, whose relationship lasted the longest.

D:Hell's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Chief Secretary, and Keeper of the Infernal Archives. He is often called upon to 
D:notarize pacts between humans and the Devil. A cantankerous spirit, he tempts men to be quarrelsome, contentious, and 
D:blasphemous. He also inspires them to commit murder. Berith is the patron devil of disobedience. 

#This dandified devil, the patron evil spirit behind passion, lechery, pleasure, luxury, and sensuality, runs the casinos and gambling houses in Hell.
#Able to appear as the most beautiful, well-dressed young man (or woman), he tempts his victims by encouraging them to buy fancy clothes and follow 
#meaningless fads. He is the prince of profligates and loves to lure happily married couples into adulterous affairs, sometimes with himself. This 
#hapless devil prides himself on arranging ridiculously inappropriate marriages and leads humans into squandering their assets. He wreaks havoc in 
#convents and monasteries by seducing their inhabitants. His mother may have been human (or, according to some, she could have been Lilith), but his
#father was an angel. When Asmodeus visits some poor human in his real form, he actually has three heads symbolic of lechery, those of a bull, 
#a ram, and a man. He also sports the feet of a rooster. He cavorts around on the back of a dragon wielding a spear. He is credited with having 
#invented carousels, music, dancing, drama, and, one may assume, recreational drug use. Asmodeus' adversary in Heaven is John the Baptist.

D:He will also take the form of a crocodile, whale, or hippopotamus and

D:of a fly and presides over the Order of the Fly. He tempts men with the grandparents of all sin, envy and pride. He can send
